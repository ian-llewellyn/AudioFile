# To Do #
[ ] "radio1" hardcoded as default service - change to first service in listservices.php
[ ] Services carousel has 'pages' hardcoded by the looks of things.
[ ] When calling the player with start and end query string params, they should have hundredths of a second also - even if they are ignored by this implementation.
[ ] Email links should be created with the hundredths of a second too.
[ ] Test times during IST (early October 2013) - email links should still be
UTC and query string should accept these. As a help, these query strings
should all produce a link to the final time PIP at 07:00 local time:
?service=radio1&start=2013-10-01-06-00-00-00
?service=radio1lw&start=2013-10-02-06-00-00-00
?service=radio1&start=2013-10-31-07-00-00-00&end=2013-10-31-18-00-00-00
[ ] "Start position must be before end mark" - should clear other (start/end) mark instead.
[ ] Volume and Service to be 'remembered' in cookies
[ ] Passing service in as query string param should choose that service.
[ ] "This program is currently unavailable" - go back more than six months and
click on a date for which there are no audios. A bug surfaces that is difficult
to recover from. I would expect the hours list to simply be empty.
[ ] Download !clip! links should not need target="_blank"

Low priority
============
[ ] When switching days, the list index of the hour is used to resume playing
at the same time another day - time should be used.
