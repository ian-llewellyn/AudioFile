# To Do #
[x] When calling the player with start and end query string params, they should have hundredths of a second also - even if they are ignored by this implementation.

[x] Email links should be created with the hundredths of a second too.

[x] Test times during IST (early October 2013) - email links should still be
UTC and query string should accept these. As a help, these query strings
should all produce a link to the final time PIP at 07:00 local time:
?service=radio1&start=2013-10-01-06-00-00-00
?service=radio1lw&start=2013-10-02-06-00-00-00
?service=radio1&start=2013-10-31-07-00-00-00&end=2013-10-31-18-00-00-00

[x] When a valid query string is passed to the interface with both start and
end times, the 'Download clip' links should both be enabled. (Only if the
audio is available? (mp2 and mp3 retention times are different.))

[x] Local / UTC Issues:
    [x] Main Time Display: Local - should be local
    [x] Mark Start/End Display: UTC - should be local (It's correct when set
        via the query string)
        [x] Load via query string, then it's possible to set the end to before
            the start - should be fixed by the parent bug!
    [x] Email link: Local - should be UTC
    [x] Download links are also based on local time (should be UTC).

[x] End param missing from email when query string used to generate mark
    start and end times.
    http://audiofile.rte.ie/player_next/?service=2fm&start=2014-03-31-04-00-00-00&end=2014-03-31-04-05-07-00
    produces email link of:
    http://audiofile.rte.ie/player_next/?service=2fm&start=2014-03-31-05-00-00-00

[x] Only mark start appears in the display area:
    http://audiofile.rte.ie/player_next/?service=2fm&start=2014-03-30-04-00-00-00&end=2014-03-30-04-05-07-00

[x] Clicking on Download clip as ... should not remove start and end marks.

[x] Download hour as MP2 is only available after clicking on an hour. This
link should be updated any time an hour is loaded - this appears to be done
except for when the player loads intially (with and without a query string).

    [x] Still not working when loaded with a query string.

[x] "Start position must be before end mark" - should clear other (start/end) mark instead.

[x] Clicking on 'Mark End' when located before a start position sets the start
    marker instead of the end marker.

[x] Passing service in as query string param should choose that service.
	- Defaults to today at 00:00:00 for playback.

[x] "This program is currently unavailable" - go back more than six months and
click on a date for which there are no audios. A bug surfaces that is difficult
to recover from. I would expect the hours list to simply be empty.

[x] "No further programs are available" - player should simply stop.

[x] Volume and Service to be 'remembered' in cookies

[x] "This program is currently unavailable." error is displayed after clicking
on the email link.

[x] Download !clip! links should not need target="_blank"

[x] Why does this link set both start and end times in the player:
    http://audiofile.rte.ie/player_next/?service=2fm&start=2014-03-31-09-00-00-00&end=2014-03-31-09-01-00-00
    and this one doesn't:
    http://audiofile.rte.ie/player_next/?service=2fm&start=2014-03-11-09-00-00-00&end=2014-03-11-09-01-00-00
    -- Issue with checking if clip covers more than 24 hours.

[x] Display date incorrect for last file in the list during IST.

---

[ ] Playing across the 24 hour mark to the next day causes the player to stop.

[ ] Loading the player and then switching to another station causes "This
    program is currently unavailable" error.

Low priority
============
[ ] When switching days, the list index of the hour is used to resume playing
at the same time another day - time should be used.

[ ] Update hrefs at relevant times rather than relying on a javascript call
when the link is clicked. (would allow right click -> Save Target As to work)

[ ] "radio1" hardcoded as default service - change to first service in listservices.php

[ ] Services carousel has 'pages' hardcoded by the looks of things.
