========[ ISSUES ]========
* init.d status should have return code 1 if the service is not running.
* af_sync_single has to call af_sync_multi for some processing - there is
  something a bit circular about that.
* Would rather af_sync_multi knew nothing about the internals of af_sync_single,
  and just ran something like af_single_instance.step() at regular intervals.
* Configuration file should be parsed rather than a Python file.
* The Client logic could be incorporated into the af_sync_multi.py file,
  allowing the init.d script to be a symlink (thus removing the ugly .py from
  it's name.
* Logging functions should be incorporated into the af_sync_single/multi.py
  files. The complex single logic is specific to single, and the multi logic
  should be simpler and apply only to multi. I don't like the idea of making
  /usr/local/lib a package directory.


========[ FIXED ]=========
* DEBUG messages coming out of af_sync_single.py when run with -v INFO
